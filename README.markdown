# PHP File Manager

IN ALFA STAGE !!!
NOT USABLE YET.

# One more File Manager

My goals with this little project is to cover some very specific needs:
- A very light-weight image gallery to allow a customer to manage all the images uploaded to a server with a custom-privative-CMS without any image gallery.
  - Allow upload new images, rename or delete existing ones, create folders to have a good distribution of files by type, category or whatever the customer needs.
  - Select an image to use in the CMS by returning the partial path of the file from the base-path, and the file name.
- Move a amount of image of more than 2000 easily and fast, with a very footprint in the server-side and a fast availability of the front-end to begin working as soon as possible.


# What are not the goals (for now) of this project:

- To have a full file manager with edit capabilities
- To have a image manipulation / edition system (just manage the files in the system)
